    question: "What is $SHITZU?",
    answer:
      "SHITZU is the quirky memecoin born from an April Fool's Day prank gone fabulously right. Picture this: a hidden mint button, a ticking clock of 24 hours, and a frenzy of clicks leading to the minting of exactly 576,167,000 SHITZU tokens. Dubbed the 'proof of finger', this one-time-only minting spree makes SHITZU a uniquely finite bundle of digital fun. No more minting, just the joy of being part of the SHITZU saga!",

    question: "What is Migration?",
    answer:
      "Migration is a strategic move by SHITZU Community to expand SHITZU's presence from Aurora to NEAR. The plan? Introduce SHITZUv2, a NEP-141 token on NEAR, and seamlessly transition from SHITZUv1 via a custom 'bridging' smart contract on Aurora. This contract, employing cross-contract calls, will burn SHITZUv1 and mint SHITZUv2, ensuring a smooth, lossless transfer for our community.",
