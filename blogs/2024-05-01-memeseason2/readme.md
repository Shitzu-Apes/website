# SHITZU xRef MemeSeason staking program

Ref Meme Season 2.0 is live, and this time you need xREF to vote for $SHITZU! A new selection of top 5 reward Meme tokens is voted by holders of xREF, with 25% boosted reward for the overall campaign (NEAR + Ref reward). Meme token projects ask xREF holders to deposit into their vault for the selection from May 1st. During the voting process, Memetoken communities can participate in donating in the 'Show love for voters' section and allocate rewards to users to incentivize them to stake xREF and vote for the Memetoken. The first voting period is a 48h window, to vote in xREF for your preferred Memetoken
After the 48h, we have the top three Memecoins selected through xREF staking
The following 24h, after the 48h, is for users to now stake their Memecoin token to compete as before
