After months of hard work, rigorous testing, and valuable feedback from our beta testers, Meme.Cooking is live and ready to disrupt the meme token space.

#### What is Meme.Cooking?

Meme.Cooking is a meme token launchpad built on NEAR Protocol and backed by Shitzu, designed to make meme token launches and trading safe, fair, and transparent. With a focus on community participation and security, we’ve created a platform where users can stake NEAR to support new projects and participate in auctions that give meme tokens a fair start.

Our approach is simple: if a coin reaches its auction goal, it’s launched and distributed fairly among the backers. If the goal isn’t met, participants receive a full refund, ensuring zero risk. This model, combined with locked liquidity for eight years, ensures that Meme.Cooking launches are unriggable and safe for all users.

#### What Sets Meme.Cooking Apart?

At Meme.Cooking, we’re not just another launchpad – we’re pioneering a new standard for fairness and security in the meme token world. Here are the key features that make us different:

- **Staking-Based Auctions**: Tokens are distributed based on the NEAR users stake during the auction, creating a fair price model.
- **Locked Liquidity**: 50% of the token supply and 100% of staked NEAR are locked on Ref Finance for eight years, ensuring long-term stability and protecting against rug pulls.
- **Refund Mechanism**: If the auction goal isn’t reached, every participant gets their staked NEAR back – no questions asked.
- **Fair Distribution**: meme tokens are distributed fairly among auction participants, giving everyone an equal opportunity to participate.

#### The Launch Process: What Happens Next?

Now that Meme.Cooking is live, you can dive right into the action. Here’s how it works:

1. **Choose a Coin**: Explore the coins that are launching on the platform.
2. **Join an Auction**: Stake your NEAR to participate in an auction for the meme token of your choice.
3. **Watch the Progress**: If the auction meets its NEAR goal, the coin is successfully launched.
4. **Fair Token Distribution**: Once the auction ends, tokens are distributed to participants based on the amount of NEAR they staked.
5. **Liquidity Locking**: After a successful launch, 50% of the token supply and all the NEAR staked are locked on Ref Finance for long-term liquidity.
