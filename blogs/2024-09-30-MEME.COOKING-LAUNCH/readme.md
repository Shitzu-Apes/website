**Title: meme.cooking Launches Today: A New Era for Memecoins on NEAR**

**Introduction:**  
The wait is over! **meme.cooking** has officially launched, and we’re thrilled to introduce this game-changing platform to the NEAR Protocol community. After months of hard work, rigorous testing, and valuable feedback from our beta testers, meme.cooking is live and ready to disrupt the memecoin space. Whether you're a memecoin enthusiast, an investor, or someone new to the world of crypto, meme.cooking offers a fair, fun, and secure way to trade and launch memecoins.

**What is meme.cooking?**  
meme.cooking is a memecoin launchpad built on NEAR Protocol, designed to make memecoin launches and trading safe, fair, and transparent. With a focus on community participation and security, we’ve created a platform where users can stake NEAR to support new projects and participate in auctions that give memecoins a fair start.

Our approach is simple: if a coin reaches its auction goal, it’s launched and distributed fairly among the backers. If the goal isn’t met, participants receive a full refund, ensuring zero risk. This model, combined with locked liquidity for eight years, ensures that meme.cooking launches are unriggable and safe for all users.

**What Sets meme.cooking Apart?**  
At meme.cooking, we’re not just another launchpad – we’re pioneering a new standard for fairness and security in the memecoin world. Here are the key features that make us different:

- **Staking-Based Auctions**: Tokens are distributed based on the NEAR users stake during the auction, creating a fair price model.
- **Locked Liquidity**: 50% of the token supply and 100% of staked NEAR are locked on Ref Finance for eight years, ensuring long-term stability and protecting against rug pulls.
- **Refund Mechanism**: If the auction goal isn’t reached, every participant gets their staked NEAR back – no questions asked.
- **Fair Distribution**: memecoins are distributed fairly among auction participants, giving everyone an equal opportunity to participate.

**The Launch Process: What Happens Next?**  
Now that meme.cooking is live, you can dive right into the action. Here’s how it works:

1. **Choose a Coin**: Explore the coins that are launching on the platform.
2. **Join an Auction**: Stake your NEAR to participate in an auction for the memecoin of your choice.
3. **Watch the Progress**: If the auction meets its NEAR goal, the coin is successfully launched.
4. **Fair Token Distribution**: Once the auction ends, tokens are distributed to participants based on the amount of NEAR they staked.
5. **Liquidity Locking**: After a successful launch, 50% of the token supply and all the NEAR staked are locked on Ref Finance for long-term liquidity.
