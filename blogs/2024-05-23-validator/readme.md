## The shit hits the fan!

We are thrilled to announce the launch of $DOGSHIT! This token will represent a percentage of participation in Shitzu's meme pool. 
$DOGSHIT is a Fungible Token (FT) used as reward for stakers with the shitzu.pool.near validator. The way it works is that the contract wraps popular memecoins like $SHITZU, $LONK and $BLACKDRAGON. 

Underlying meme tokens can be claimed by burning the ðŸ’©! 

You can stake your $NEAR directly through [app.shitzuapes.xyz](https://app.shitzuapes.xyz/stake) which currently supports Meteor- and Here wallet. 
Our app also reflects the proper APY. Alternatively, you can stake from telegram via the [HOT wallet](https://t.me/herewalletbot/app?startapp=web-shitzuapes).
Below a small tutorial how to stake through [mynearwallet](https://www.mynearwallet.com):
