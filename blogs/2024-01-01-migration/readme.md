# The Great Migration

Originally minted as an April Fool's campaign by Bastion Protocol, SHITZU became Aurora's unique meme coin with a locked total of 576,167,000 tokens. Addressing the isolation on Aurora due to the lack of a direct bridging solution, SHITZU's core contributors propose the creation of SHITZUv2 on NEAR. This innovative migration, leveraging Aurora's cross-contract calls, ensures a one-way, user-friendly transition from SHITZUv1 to SHITZUv2 without financial loss. The plan includes a novel arbitrage mechanism to maintain SHITZU's value across both tokens and platforms. With extensive experience from previous projects, contributor Mario is set to spearhead this technical evolution, inviting the community to partake in a decisive on-chain vote for a vibrant, interconnected future for SHITZU in the NEAR & Aurora ecosystem.
