## An exclusive collaboration promoting ecosystem growth
Shitzu recently launched a strategic partnership with [@intelnear](https://twitter.com/intelnear)!
The partnership will consist of the following commitments:
-   Marketing support
    -   Shitzu will provide boosts and general Twitter support on major Intear announcements in the future.
 
- Cross-promotion
	-   Commitment to cross-promote our projects to our respective communities through giveaways, X spaces, beta testing of products.

-   Joint events
	-   Commitment to collaborate on in-person events in the future such as EthCC and [Redacted] in Bangkok in November.

- Shared knowledge & expertise
  -   Intear will likely look to create an NFT in the future - and Shitzu can assist in providing expertise and knowledge after the recent successful Shitzu Revival NFT launch.

In addition to the above, Intear will direct their community to support Shitzu's to secure it's seat in Ref Meme Season 3.0!

We see this partnership as a commitment to both our communities, that we are going to continue to look to build and return value to holders while having fun doing so!
